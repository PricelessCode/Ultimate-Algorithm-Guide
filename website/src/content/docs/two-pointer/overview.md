Two-pointer problems are a class of problems that can be solved using two pointers moving through the dataset, typically a linear data structure such as an array or a linked list. These problems can often be solved more efficiently with two pointers than would be possible using only one.
 
Do note that Two Pointers can be iterated using either `while` and `for` loops. Also, you can decide whether `left pointer` or `right pointer` should be placed in the outer loop based your coding styles.


Typically there are 4 Types of Two Pointer Algorithms.

1. Collision Pointers
2. Forward Pointers (a.k.a Sliding Window)
3. Parallel Pointers
4. Fast Slow Pointers (a.k.a Cyclic Pointers)


Let's have a look into these in the next chapter!
