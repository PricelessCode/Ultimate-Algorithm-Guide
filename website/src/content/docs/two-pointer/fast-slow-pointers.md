4. Fast and Slow Pointers (Cyclic Pointers)
These pointers move at different speeds, typically in linked lists. The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. This technique is useful in problems involving cycles, such as detecting a cycle in a linked list or finding the middle of a linked list. If a cycle exists, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer.
