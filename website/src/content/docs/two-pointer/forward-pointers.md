title: Forward Pointers
description: Learning Two Pointers
---

These pointers start at the same position and move to one direction. This approach is typically used in problems involving subarrays or subsequences where you need to keep track of a contiguous block of elements. For example, the problem of finding the longest substring with no repeating characters can be solved using this approach.

Forward Pointers technique is also as known as Sliding Window technique where each left pointer and right pointer proceeds in the same direction and the two pointers form `windows` if this makes sense haha

There are Two Sub-categories for Forward Pointers.

1. Fixed Size  
   This means the `window` size is fixed.

2. Flexible Size  
   This means the `window` size is changing according to the conditions.
