Kadane's algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm used to solve the problem of finding the maximum subarray sum in an array of integers. This is also known as the maximum subarray problem.

Maximum difference of 0's and 1's in a binary string
Maximum Sum Circular array
Smallest sum contiguous subarray
Largest sum increasing contiguous subarray
Maximum Product Subarray
Largest sum contiguous subarray with only non-negative elements.
Largest sum contiguous subarray with unique elements.
Maximum Alternating Sum Subarray
Maximum Sum Rectangle In A 2D Matrix
