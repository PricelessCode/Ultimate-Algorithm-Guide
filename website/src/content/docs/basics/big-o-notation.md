### 1. Big O Notation :dart:

When you study Algorithms, you will see a lot of notations like `O(n)`, `O(nlogn)` and such. No need to be lost! :) This is just a mark of how much the time/space cost will approximately take for the given algorithm.
`n` refers to the size of the input.

Here are some examples of Big O Notation:

-   **O(1)**: The cost is irrelevant of the input size `n`
-   **O(n)**: The cost is linear of the input size `n`
-   **O(nlogn)**: Oh wow, The cost increases in proportion to nlogn of the input size `n`
-   **O(n^2)**: Oh... The cost increases in proportion to n^2 of the input size `n`
-   **O(n!)**: Omg!! The cost increases in proportion to factorial of the input size `n`!
